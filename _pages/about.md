I am Johannes, a recently graduated security engineer seeking to learn something new each day and to make our world a more reliable place.
## My motivation
Each day, millions of people, including you and me lay make their lifes dependent on technology. Be it the pump that provides our water, the grid that carries our electricity, the car, train or plane we rely on for transportation, or the medical device that keeps us alive. Our most simple needs, and our physical wellbeing directly rely on those techologies. But are they even reliable? Those systems at the core of our lifes increasingly become subject to cyber attacks of various natures - from thrill-seekers and activists to organized cyber crime and nation states. I work in cyber security to push back on those threats and to contribute to a tomorrow, were we can still rely on our everyday technologies.
## My vision?
My vision is a world where we can trust the techologies we rely on each day. A world, were interconnectivity, effectivity and intelligence are not impeded by security concerns, eaven within the most critical systems.
## How do I contribute?
To be able to contribute to this vision, we security engineers need to provide excellent work every day.This is not a simple task: An addversary only needs to find one weakness. We need to find and close all of them. We not only need to know how to define and apply processes like threat assessments and risk analysis. We also need to understand how adverseries think and carry out their assaults on critical systems. Further, it is not enough for us to know the approximate functionality of or sytem. As Sparkflow put it in his book "How to hack like a ghost": We need to understand the deep core of what we are working with to not only apply the rules, but to bend them.
